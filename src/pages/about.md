# About 3AM

Welcome to 3AM, where the night is our playground and curiosity is our guide. 
We are the founding Night Owls:

db2 - An entrepreneur who ventures into virtual worlds.

Spooky Joe - A musician whose melodies soundtrack the mysteries of the night.

mainframe - An engineer crafting a labyrinth of interconnected timelines.

blastoff - A culture aficionado spotting trends before they become orthodoxy.

chunkypumkin - A pilot bending the physical and digital world through uncharted territories.

Together, we've created 3AM as a beacon for those who live for the thrill of discovery under the cover of night. Here, every moment is an adventure, every connection a story waiting to unfold. 

Carpe Noctem.
